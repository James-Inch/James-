        I was born in England in 1992(26 years old), I lived in Stoke-on-trent until I was 11. In 2003 my family and
        I moved to North Carolina. I graduated from Mallard creek Highschool in 2010, after which I shipped off to
        Marine Corps basic training at MCRD Paris Island, SC. I joined the Marines to be an aviation mechanic, more
        specifically a Hydraulic technicion/ Airframe mechanic. After bootcamp and Marine Combat Trainnig, I headed
        down to Naval Air Station Pencacola, FL. I graduated top of my class which enabled me to choose which platform
        I would ultimately be working on. I chose the CH-53, the Sea Stalion, which is a Heavy lift troop transport
        helicopter. The training for the CH-53 took me to Marine Corps Air Station(MCAS) New River. After graduating
        top of my class, again, our entire class got orders to be stationed at MCAS Kaneohe Bay HI.

          I Like to consider myself the adventurous type, in the four years I lived in Hawaii I spent most of my time hiking, mountain
          biking, skating and cliff jumping. I started a motorcycle club called Scallywags MC, with some friends I
          met throuht my tattoo artist. It was a legit club, we got promision from the Oahu Motorcycle Club Counsil
          to wear a 3 piece patch as long as our bottom rocker didnt read, Hawaii, Oahu or Honolulu. So naturally we
          claimed the seven seas.

          I graduate the Full Stack Web Development course at UNC Charlotte
          in December of last year (2018) Where I learned HTML, CSS and
          JavaScript along with mySQl and MongoBD. I also learned Node.js,
          Express, React.js and used Handlebars, Bootstarp, firebase and
          jQuery. With 10 hours a week of in class instruction and lectures
          we were exposed to these technologies, then we had assignments
          each week that incorporated what we had learned. I spent
          countless hours on stack overflow and MDN reading through code
          to refine my problem solving skills to complete my homework
          assignments. Since my graduation I have continuously worked on 
          my development skills and added technologies to my developer tool 
          belt.
