        <p> I was born in England in 1992(26 years old), I lived in Stoke-on-trent until I was 11. In 2003 my family and
            I moved to North Carolina. I graduated from Mallard creek Highschool in 2010, after which I shipped off to
            Marine Corps basic training at MCRD Paris Island, SC. I joined the Marines to be an aviation mechanic, more
            specifically a Hydraulic technicion/ Airframe mechanic. After bootcamp and Marine Combat Trainnig, I headed
            down to Naval Air Station Pencacola, FL. I graduated top of my class which enabled me to choose which platform
            I would ultimately be working on. I chose the CH-53, the Sea Stalion, which is a Heavy lift troop transport
            helicopter. The training for the CH-53 took me to Marine Corps Air Station(MCAS) New River. After graduating
            top of my class, again, our entire class got orders to be stationed at MCAS Kaneohe Bay HI.

            I Like to consider myself the adventurous type, in the four years I lived in Hawaii I spent most of my time hiking, mountain
            biking, skating and cliff jumping. I started a motorcycle club called Scallywags MC, with some friends I
            met throuht my tattoo artist. It was a legit club, we got promision from the Oahu Motorcycle Club Counsil
            to wear a 3 piece patch as long as our bottom rocker didnt read, Hawaii, Oahu or Honolulu. So naturally we
            claimed the seven seas.
